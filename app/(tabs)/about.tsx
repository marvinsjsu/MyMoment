      Too often, being in waiting rooms for appointments, my older daughter and I
      would try to find things to do together to pass time before being
      called in. At one of these appointments, I thought why not find and
      download a "Connect-Four" game from the Apple App store - Sophia loves
      trying to beat me in this game üòùüòâüòä. We ended up downloading a few,
      and all of these had us go through a bunch of ads for other games
      before we could play. Well, I thought why not build an app with a
      few of the games my daughter enjoyed and make it without any ads.
